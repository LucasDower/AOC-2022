# Advent of Code 2022

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

Usually I'm looking to get the answer and move on. If the problem is especially interesting to me I'll make a pretty or optimised solution. Each solution is designed to be runnable on any AoC input and with zero assumptions about the input.
